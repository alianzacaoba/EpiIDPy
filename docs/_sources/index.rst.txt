Welcome to SIRPy's documentation!
=================================
The Epidemiology of infectious diseases in Python (EpilDPy) is a framework designed to help scientists and
public health officials create and use models of emerging infectious diseases. This framework uses
mathematical models of diseases (based on differential equations) to simulate the development or
evolution of a disease in time. Also, the framework is founded on an Object-Oriented Programing and
Software design pattern approaches in order to optimize the simulation processes of the models.
The following illustrates and describes the process of creating a EpilDPy type of model.
